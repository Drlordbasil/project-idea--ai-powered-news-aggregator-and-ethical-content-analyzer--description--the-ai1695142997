The program uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape news articles from reputable online sources. Users can specify criteria such as keywords, topics, or ethical categories to search for articles. The program retrieves articles based on these criteria, ensuring a diverse range of news sources.

### Ethical Analysis

The program leverages natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of each news article. It evaluates the article's overall ethical stance by assessing factors such as bias, credibility, social impact, and adherence to ethical principles. This analysis helps users understand the ethical implications of the news they're reading.

### Curated News Feed

Based on the results of the ethical analysis, the program generates a curated news feed that presents users with articles that align with their ethical values. Users can customize their preferences and prioritize different ethical categories, ensuring a tailored news feed experience.

### Ethical Decision-Making Insights

The program provides users with insights and analysis on key ethical elements found in the news articles. These insights empower users to make informed decisions by highlighting potential ethical controversies, conflicts of interest, or positive societal impacts mentioned in the articles.

### Personalized Recommendations

Over time, the program learns from user preferences and behaviors to provide personalized article recommendations. The recommendation engine utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest relevant and ethical news articles based on users' ethical preferences and past reading history.

### Accessibility and Usability
